# UWP-TextRPG
UWP application of a simple text RPG prototype. This project was intended to help me get started at UWP development, even though it does not need to use many complex functionalities.

The current scheme of adding 'scenes' to the game does not seem truly scalable, but the game as a whole is working as I first planned it to.
